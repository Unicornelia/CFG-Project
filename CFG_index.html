    <h2>Psychology</h2>
    <p>Taking care of our psyche is just as important as to care for our body.</p>
    <p> Our holistic centre believes that everyone can experience times in their lives that are hard to deal with and
      a little extra help could move you from that tipping point. </p>
      <p>If you are interested please contact one of our consultants for private counselling sessions.</p>
      <p> We follow a holistic approach in councelling too, combining traditional and modern techniques,
        focusing on the whole person, rather than just one single problem.</p>
